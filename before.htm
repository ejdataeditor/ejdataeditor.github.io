            <h1>Before you submit your paper for the first time</h1>
            <p>
                Read here about our Data Policy and make sure you comply with all requirements before you submit the paper for the first time. Check the cases in which exemptions to the policy can be granted and the procedures to obtain them. If you don't request the exemption at the time of first submission, you will not be able to do it later!
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="policy">Data Policy</h2>
            
            <p>
                (This is a reproduction of the official Data Policy of the Economic Journal, which can be found <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/pages/General_Instructions#data">here</a>. In case of discrepancy, the official Data Policy always prevails to the reproduction presented here.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The Economic Journal requires authors of empirical, experimental or numerical papers to provide documentation of how their results were obtained in sufficient detail and accuracy to allow their results to be replicated. When you submit a paper for consideration, you will be asked to confirm that you are willing to comply with this policy. <b>It is essential that you request data exemption at the point of submission if you are using proprietary data or any other restrictions on supplying the data.</b>
            </p>
            <h3>Empirical papers</h3>
            <p>
                For papers that contain descriptive, econometric or simulated analysis of data, the authors must provide sufficient detail in the paper (or in an appendix) for the reader to understand the nature of the data used and how it was analyzed to produce the results, as well as a replication package containing the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A ReadMe file (ReadMe.pdf) describing the content of the package, the data sources, any manipulation that was carried out to generate the final datasets, how the data and programs can be used to replicate the results in the paper, the version of the software the code was written for and the respective versions of extra packages, as well as an estimate of the computation time. In case of commercially available or restricted access data sources, detailed instructions (e.g. extraction code) to obtain the datasets should be included in the ReadMe file.</li>
                <li>The datasets used in the analysis, including a complete, transparent and precise documentation describing all variables. If the data is provided in a proprietary format, such as in STATA format, then an ASCII file should also be provided. Authors are encouraged to provide any intermediary dataset and code used to produce the final datasets. Authors not submitting these are expected to cooperate with researchers seeking access to these datasets for replication purposes.</li>
                <li>All codes necessary to re-produce the tables and figures in the paper as well as supplements and appendices. In case of simulation/Monte Carlo studies, the authors are requested to set a seed so that the exact numbers that are reported can be obtained. If the code uses additional packages that are not part of the standard distribution, then these packages should be included so that the code still runs after many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Authors who have requested an exemption for the publication of their datasets can either (1) grant temporary distance or physical access to the data to the journal's staff for the sole purpose of replication (the data will not be published), or (2) supply a simulated dataset or a synthetic dataset instead of the actual dataset(s) used for the analysis for replication purposes. The nature of the data used for replication checks will be indicated on the published version of the paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                Acceptance will only be granted after the results have been checked for replication.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the paper is accepted for publication, the replication package will be posted on the journal's website alongside the paper. Submission indicates that you license users to download, copy, and modify this material. Users of the material must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and the Economic Journal as the original publisher. The editorial board of the Economic Journal reserves the right to refuse publication of those papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements.
            </p>
            <h3>Experimental papers</h3>
            <p>
                For papers that contain analysis of experimental data, we require the authors to provide at the time of submission of the paper (authors are asked to include all information as part of the main pdf file rather than as separate items):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A document outlining the design of the experiment.</li>
                <li>A copy of the instructions given to participants, in both the original language and an English translation.</li>
                <li>Information on the selection and eligibility of participants.</li>
                <li>Explicit reference to the approval of the Institutional Review Board of one of the authors' institutions (IRB approval number, date, name of the institution).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition, before final acceptance, the authors will be asked to submit a replication package containing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A ReadMe file (ReadMe.pdf) describing the content of the package, how the data and programs can be used to replicate the results in the paper, the version of the software the code was written for and the respective versions of extra packages, as well as an estimate of the computation time.</li>
                <li>The programs used to analyze the data or run the experiment;</li>
                <li>The raw data collected from the experiment;</li>
                <li>A copy of the IRB approval.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Acceptance will only be granted after the results have been checked for replication.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the paper is accepted for publication, the replication package will be posted on the journal's website alongside the paper. Submission indicates that you license users to download, copy, and modify this material. Users of the material must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and the Economic Journal as the original publisher. The editorial board of the Economic Journal reserves the right to refuse publication of those papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="exemptions">Apply to exemptions to the Data Policy</h2>
            
            <p>
                If you are not able to comply with some of the aspects of the Data Policy (e.g. because you are using restricted-access data or you cannot obtain permission to re-publish the data), you should request an exemption <b>at the time of first submission</b>. You can find a set of FAQs questions about the situations under which you can or cannot apply to an exemption to the data policy <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you want to request a Data Exemption, you need to select the following option for the Data Policy tab during your submission process at the Editorial Express platform:
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Data_policy.png" alt="Data exemption" class="w3-center w3-image">
            <p>
                Additionally, attach a Cover Letter along with your paper in which you indicate the reasons why you believe you are entitled to an exemption to our data policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the paper is submitted, the Managing Editor will analyze whether (i) there are enough grounds to grant the exemption and (ii) does the exemption or the type of data limit the interest of the paper. Based on her assessment of these two points, she will make one of the following decisions: (a) move forward with the process, sending your paper to referees, (b) summarily reject your paper, or (c) contact you asking to provide additional information, documentation, or any other requirement that she needs to assess the suitability of the requested exemption. The exemptions are tacitly granted by choosing option (a).
            </p>
            <p>
                Once your paper is conditionally accepted, you will be requested to supply your replication package according to the guidelines specified <a href="package.htm">here</a>. If an exemption to the Data Policy was granted, you will be requested to either provide the Data Editor (and the team of replications) with temporary access to the data affected by the exemption for the sole purpose of implementing the reproducibility checks, or to include in your package a synthetic or simulated dataset that allows to run the code and check that it produces all outputs from the paper (and appendices), even if the results do not match those in the paper. You can find a set of FAQs questions about how to proceed with the replication package when an exemption to the data policy has been granted <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a>.
