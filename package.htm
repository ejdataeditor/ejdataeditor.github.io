            <h1>Prepare and submit your replication package</h1>
            <p>
                After your Managing Editor conditionally accepts your paper (and before she sees your final response and proceeds to final acceptance) your paper will go through reproducibility and anti-plagiarism checks. Therefore, in your last re-submission you are requested to submit, via Editorial Express, your final files for production, your online appendices, and your replication package. It is important that you carefully follow the instructions below to ensure that your paper and your replication package are not mishandled. This page provides you with detailed information that will help you preparing your replication package. Read it carefully before you submit!
                
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
            
            <p>
                You are <b>requested</b> to submit a single zip file with the following <b>folder structure</b> (please name your folders this way!):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>&quot;1-paper&quot;</li>
                <li>&quot;2-appendices&quot;</li>
                <li>&quot;3-replication-package&quot;</li>
                <li>&quot;4-confidential-data-not-for-publication&quot; (Optional: include only the restricted data if an exemption to the Data and Code Availability Policy have been granted to you and you are providing the replication team with temporary access to the data; all codes and not restricted data should go to folder 3)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                For folders 1 and 2, please refer to the Economic Journal's <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/pages/General_Instructions">General Instructions to Authors</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/DocumentLibrary/EJ/Guide_for_Accepted_Authors_19.pdf">Guide for Accepted Authors</a> and carefully follow the instructions indicated there. In the lines below, you will find specific guidelines about folder 3 and, if you were granted a data exemption at the time of first submission (see <a href="before.htm#exemptions">here</a>,  <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>, and <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a> for details), also folder 4. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with your package, you are requested to submit the following <b><a href="https://www.res.org.uk/uploads/assets/4a873d6e-04b2-4d3b-a335e767d105648a/7b27f404-356f-4740-bf795ed652f00750/Checklist-for-Authors.pdf">checklist</a></b> completely filled and signed.

            <h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
            
            <p>
                As indicated in the journal's <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/pages/General_Instructions#data">Data and Code Availability Policy</a> all packages should include the following information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>ReadMe file</b> in PDF format (ReadMe.pdf). We strongly recommend using the following <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/">template</a>. You may find in this web <a href="https://www.templatereadme.org/">app</a> a convenient tool to create your ReadMe file.</li>
                <li>The <b>raw datasets</b> used in the paper and online appendices, including a complete, transparent and precise documentation describing all variables. You can additionally provide the analysis data if this is helpful, but they are not required if the raw data are provided. If you were granted a data exemption at the time of first submission (see <a href="before.htm#exemptions">here</a>,  <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>, and <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a> for details), you should either provide the replication team with <b>temporary access</b> to the data for the sole purpose of performing the reproducibility checks, or you should submit a <b>synthetic/simulated</b> dataset that allows running the code and produce all outputs in the paper and appendices, even if the results do not match those in the paper.</li>
                <li>The data <b>cleaning codes</b> and the <b>analysis codes</b> that produce all reproducible outputs reported in the article, appendix, and online appendices (including figures, tables, and numbers reported in the text). If some results are produced without scripts (e.g. ArcGIS maps), the ReadMe file should include step-by-step very detailed instructions on how to produce that output. In case of simulation/Monte Carlo studies, the authors are requested to set a seed so that the exact numbers that are reported can be obtained.</li>
                <li>If data are provided in proprietary format (e.g. Stata's .dta), a <b>copy of the data in non-proprietary format</b> (e.g. ASCII, csv).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			    <b>Experimental papers</b> should additionally include the following PDF documents (if these files are part of the paper or of an appendix, copy them again in a separate document and include them in the replication package):
            </p>
			<ul>
                <li>A document outlining the <b>design</b> of the experiment.</li>
                <li>A copy of the <b>instructions</b> given to participants, in both the original language and an English translation.</li>
                <li>Information on the <b>selection and eligibility</b> of participants.</li>
                <li>A PDF copy of the <b>Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval</b> of one of the authors' institutions (IRB approval number, date, name of the institution) or an explicit mention that an exemption has been granted by the Editorial Board.</li>
            </ul>            

            <h2 id="readme">ReadMe file</h2>
            
            <p>
                The ReadMe file should provide enough instructions so that all users (level of an advanced PhD student and above) can reproduce all the results in the paper in a reasonable amount of time and without problems. We strongly recommend using the following <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/">template</a>.  You may find in this web <a href="https://www.templatereadme.org/">app</a> a convenient tool to create your ReadMe file. The minimum required information includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Description</b> of the content of the package (datasets, programs, folders, etc.)</li>
                <li><b>Data Availability Statement</b>: precise indications on how the data were obtained, including required registrations, memberships, application procedures, monetary cost, or other qualifications, and, if applicable, URL to download them (which is typically part of the data citation).</li>
                <li>Precise <b>instructions</b> on how to run the code.</li>
                <li>Indications on <b>where to find each output</b> saved/displayed in the package's output.</li>
                <li><b>Software requirements</b>, including the software version and operating system used by the authors.</li>
                <li>All <b>packages and libraries</b> that need to be installed to run the code and a clear indication on how to obtain them.</li>
                <li>Expected <b>running time</b> (even if it is a few seconds). When relevant, include the hardware that the estimated time refers to.</li>
                <li><b>Data citations</b>: all datasets used in the paper (with no exceptions) should be listed in the references section of the <b>paper</b> in the same way that we cite other papers, and a copy of these citations should appear in a dedicated section of the <b>ReadMe</b> file. You can find some examples in page 7 of <a href="https://bit.ly/3ivH38d">this document</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="citations">Data citations</h2>
            
            <p>
                All datasets used in the paper (with no exceptions) should be listed in the references section of the <b>paper</b> in the same way that we cite other papers, and a copy of these citations should appear in a dedicated section of the <b>ReadMe</b> file.

            </p>
            <p>
                If the data used in the study is part of the replication package of another paper, both the paper and the replication package should be cited. Even commonly used datasets should be cited (in fact, funding of public and private institutions that make datasets available, even the most widely used ones, crucially depends on data citations!).
            </p>
            <p>

            <h2 id="best-practices">Best practices</h2>
            
            <p>
                There is a set of practices that are strongly recommended for all replication packages. The following list includes some of them (acknowledgedly, you are probably seeing some of them too late in the production process, but we strongly encourage you to take a good note for your future research!):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always keep your raw data intact (i.e. read-only). Generate separate analysis datasets to perform analysis.</li>
                <li>Generate your analysis data using programs, many journals require you to submit them.</li>
                <li>Datasets change over time, keep a record of the date and versions you obtained. It might be difficult to obtain it in the future.</li>
                <li>Separate code and data in your directory structure. This will facilitate (i) keeping versions of your code, and (ii) producing a replication package.</li>
                <li>Use programs/scripts as opposed to command-line instructions!</li>
                <li>Design your code to be run all at once, and not section by section. Create a master file that call all other subsidiary files.</li>
                <li>Use log-files. Make sure that the code stores the output as opposed to only showing it on the screen during runtime.</li>
                <li>Make your code produce all tables and figures as they appear in the manuscript: you will save a lot of time!</li>
                <li>Set the paths only once and at the top of the master-file, and then use either relative paths or global variables, so that users don't have to change the paths in multiple parts of your code.</li>
                <li>Whenever possible, write paths in a way that is compatible across different operating systems. For example, in Stata, always use forward slashes &quot;/&quot; to separate directories, even if you use Windows.</li>
                <li>Run your codes from the replication folder before you submit and make sure it runs and all your results are reproduced.</li>
                <li>If you are using not pre-compiled software (e.g. Fortran, C, etc.), use make files (or else make sure you provide very detailed instructions on how to compile the different files).</li>
                <li>Name your files in a wise manner. For example, if your output generates tables and figures as new files, give them names that easily identify them. Also, name your master file as &quot;Main&quot;, &quot;Master&quot; or something similar.</li>
                <li>Use sub-folders when your package includes a lot of files. Make sure that your package includes all relevant folders, even empty folders that will be filled with the outputs from the program.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Submit your final files and replication package via <b><a href="https://editorialexpress.com/ej">Editorial Express</a></b>. If size permits, submit all files into one zip file. If necessary, you can split your zip file into multiple smaller size files (for example using <a href="https://kb.winzip.com/help/winzip/help_splitdlg.htm">this</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                If, even <a href="https://kb.winzip.com/help/winzip/help_splitdlg.htm">splitting zip files</a>, the files are still too large for the Editorial Express platform, please arrange an alternative transfer method with the Data Editor at <a href="mailto:ejdataeditor@gmail.com">ejdataeditor&#64;gmail.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you were granted a data exemption <b>at the time of first submission</b> (see <a href="before.htm#exemptions">here</a>,  <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>, and <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a> for details), and you are allowed to provide the Data Editor and the replication team with temporary access to your restricted data for the sole purpose of the reproducibility checks, you should include the confidential data <b>in a separate folder</b> named &quot;4-confidential-data-not-for-publication&quot;.

                If you can provide temporary access but not by sharing the data in the &quot;4-confidential-data-not-for-publication&quot; folder,  please contact the Data Editor at <a href="mailto:ejdataeditor@gmail.com">ejdataeditor&#64;gmail.com</a> to arrange an alternative access method. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A few days after you submitted the package (in most of the cases, within two weeks) you will be contacted by the Data Editor with the outcome of the reproducibility checks, regardless of whether the checks were successful or there are modifications to be made. <b>Please add ejdataeditor&#64;gmail.com and ej_joanllull&#64;editorialexpress.com to your safe contacts</b> to avoid that the Data Editor's messages go to spam!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to implement modifications of your package, you will be instructed to do so in the Data Editor's response. You will iterate with the Data Editor until the reproducibility checks are satisfactory concluded.

            <h2 id="publish">After the reproducibility checks are completed: publish your package</h2>
            
            <p>
                <b>Once the reproducibility checks are concluded</b>, you will be requested to do an additional step: to publish your replication package at the <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/ej-replication-repository">Economic Journal's community of Zenodo</a>. To do so, you need to complete the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you don't have a Zendo account to publish your files, you may sign up <a href="https://zenodo.org/signup/">here</a> following very simple steps.</li>
                <li>Go to the Economic Journal's community of Zenodo at <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/ej-replication-repository">https://zenodo.org/communities/ej-replication-repository</a>.</li>
                <li>Start a new upload within the community using the top-right green button in the screen.</li>
                <img src="Images/Zenodo.png" alt="Zenodo upload" class="w3-center w3-image">
                <li>Compress your replication package (the <b>exact</b> folder &quot;3-replication-package&quot; that went through the reproducibility checks) on a zip file. Drag-and-drop the zip file to upload it. Make sure you only publish the replication package and not the paper or online appendices. Especially, <b>do not publish the content of the  &quot;4-confidential-data-not-for-publication&quot; folder!</b></li>
                <img src="Images/Zenodo_drag_and_drop.png" alt="Zenodo drag and drop" class="w3-center w3-image">
                <li>Click on the Start upload green button to upload.</li>
                <img src="Images/Zenodo_start_upload.png" alt="Zenodo start upload" class="w3-center w3-image">
                <li>If you didn't skip step 2, your upload is already linked to the Economic Journal's community.<br>&nbsp;

                        <li>Title: <i>Replication package for: &quot;&#123;full title of your manuscript&#125;&quot;</i>.</li>
                        <li>Authors: Typically the same authors as the manuscript, but you can add others who have contributed significantly to the code you are uploading, such as research assistants (in that case, you are making them coauthors of your replication package, but not of the paper).</li>
                        <li>Description: write a full citation to your manuscript as a description of what the replication package contains.</li>
                        <li>Other optional metadata: don't worry about this, you can leave it blank.</li>

                <li>Save the &quot;Digital Object Identifier&quot; (DOI) issued by Zenodo (see the image above) and email it to the Editorial Office at <a href="mailto:ej@res.org.uk">ej@res.org.uk</a>. This DOI will appear in your published paper, and will hence link your article and your package.</li>
                <li>Save and then Publish using the corresponding buttons that appear both at the bottom and at the page.</li>
                <img src="Images/Zenodo_save_publish.png" alt="Zenodo save publish" class="w3-center w3-image">
                <li>Send an email to the Data Editor which includes the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum">md5 string</a> displayed on the zenodo page of your replication package (see below). This string serves to check whether the files included in the package, which the Data Editor has accepted, are <b>exactly identical</b> to the ones you uploaded to zenodo. This string is like an electronic fingerprint of your replication package. It's important to note that you must not modify your package after final acceptance in any way (add/remove files or make edits), or this check will fail. What you upload needs to be <b>exactly identical</b> (at the bit-level of the contained files) to what you sent us in your final iteration.</li>

                <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> once you press publish, you will <b>not be able to edit or delete</b> your uploaded files. You can create new versions of your upload at any point in the future, but these versions will have a different DOI (they will be linked to your earlier and future versions of the package, but they will not be directly linked to your paper). <b>Please double-check that you publish the files that went through the reproducibility checks, and that you are not publishing the content you submitted in the folder  &quot;4-confidential-data-not-for-publication&quot;</b>.
