            <h1>Prepare and submit your replication package</h1>
            <p>
                After your Managing Editor conditionally accepts your paper (and before she sees your final response and proceeds to final acceptance) your paper will go through reproducibility and anti-plagiarism checks. Therefore, in your last re-submission you are requested to submit, via Editorial Express, your final files for production, your online appendices, and your replication package. It is important that you carefully follow the instructions below to ensure that your paper and your replication package are not mishandled. This page provides you with detailed information that will help you preparing your replication package. Read it carefully before you submit!
                
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
            
            <p>
                You are requested to submit a single zip file with the following folder structure (please name your folders this way!):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Paper</li>
                <li>2 Appendices</li>
                <li>3 Replication package</li>
                <li>Optional: 4 Confidential data not for publication</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                For folders 1 and 2, please refer to the Economic Journal's <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/pages/General_Instructions">General Instructions to Authors</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/DocumentLibrary/EJ/Guide_for_Accepted_Authors_19.pdf">Guide for Accepted Authors</a> and carefully follow the instructions indicated there. In the lines below, you will find specific guidelines about folder 3 and, if you were granted a data exemption at the time of first submission (see <a href="before.htm#exemptions">here</a>,  <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>, and <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a> for details), also folder 4. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with your package, you are requested to submit the following <a href="https://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/ej/document/Checklist_for_authors_July2020.pdf?node=d63a8d83ba1a1421c6f1&version=263849:ae02e800bfdafd0dbf0f">checklist</a> completely filled and signed.
            </p>
            
            
            <h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
            
            <p>
                As indicated in the journal's <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/pages/General_Instructions#data">Data Policy</a> all packages should include the following information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A ReadMe file in PDF format (ReadMe.pdf). We strongly recommend using the following <a href="https://social-science-dataeditors.github.io/guidance/template-README.html">template</a>.</li>
                <li>The datasets used in the analysis, including a complete, transparent and precise documentation describing all variables. If you were granted a data exemption at the time of first submission (see <a href="before.htm#exemptions">here</a>,  <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>, and <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a> for details), you should either provide temporary access to the replication team for the sole purpose of reproducibility checks, or you should submit a synthetic/simulated dataset that allows running the code and produce all outputs in the paper and appendices, even if the results do not match those in the paper.</li>
                <li>The codes that produce all reproducible outputs reported in the article, appendix, and online appendices (including figures, tables, and numbers reported in the text). If some results are produced without scripts (e.g. ArcGIS maps), the ReadMe file should include step-by-step very detailed instructions on how to produce that output. In case of simulation/Monte Carlo studies, the authors are requested to set a seed so that the exact numbers that are reported can be obtained.</li>
                <li>If data are provided in proprietary format (e.g. Stata's .dta), a copy of the data in non-proprietary format (e.g. ASCII, csv).</li>
                <li>(Optional but strongly recommended) The raw data and the data cleaning and manipulation codes.</li>
                Experimental papers should additionally include the following PDF documents (if these files are part of the paper or of an appendix, copy them again in a separate document and include them in the replication package):
                <li>A document outlining the design of the experiment.</li>
                <li>A copy of the instructions given to participants, in both the original language and an English translation.</li>
                <li>Information on the selection and eligibility of participants.</li>
                <li>A PDF copy of the Institutional Review Board of one of the authors' institutions (IRB approval number, date, name of the institution).</li>
            </ul>            

            <h2 id="readme">ReadMe file</h2>
            
            <p>
                The ReadMe file should provide enough instructions so that all users (level of an advanced PhD student and above) can reproduce all the results in the paper in a reasonable amount of time and without problems. We strongly recommend using the following <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/">template</a>. The minimum required information includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Description of the content of the package (datasets, programs, folders, etc.)</li>
                <li>Precise instructions on how to run the code.</li>
                <li>Indications on where to find each output saved/displayed in the package's output.</li>
                <li>Software used, including the software version and operating system.</li>
                <li>All packages and libraries that need to be installed to run the code and a clear indication on how to obtain them.</li>
                <li>Expected running time (even if it is a few seconds). When relevant, include the setup that the estimated time refers to.</li>
                <li>Data citations for all datasets used in the analysis (they should be included both in the ReadMe file and in the article).</li>
                <li>Data Availability Statement: precise indications on how the data were obtained, including required registrations, memberships, application procedures, monetary cost, or other qualifications, and, if applicable, URL to download them (which is typically part of the data citation).</li>
                <li>When the raw data and data cleaning and manipulation codes are not provided, precise instructions on how the final datasets were generated from the raw files.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="citations">Data citations</h2>
            
            <p>
                Both the article and the ReadMe file should cite all datasets used in the study. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If the data used in the study is part of the replication package of another paper, both the paper and the replication package should be cited. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even commonly used datasets should be cited (in fact, funding of public and private institutions that make datasets available, even the most widely used ones, crucially depends on data citations!).
            </p>
            <p>
                More specific guidance on data citations is available <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/addtl-data-citation-guidance.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="best-practices">Best practices</h2>
            
            <p>
                There is a set of practices that are strongly recommended for all replication packages. The following list includes some of them (acknowledgedly, you are probably seeing some of them too late in the production process, but we strongly encourage you to take a good note for your future research!):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always keep your raw data intact (i.e. read-only). Generate separate analysis datasets to perform analysis.</li>
                <li>Generate your analysis data using programs, many journals require you to submit them.</li>
                <li>Datasets change over time, keep a record of the date and versions you obtained. It might be difficult to obtain it in the future.</li>
                <li>Separate code and data in your directory structure. This will facilitate (i) keeping versions of your code, and (ii) producing a replication package.</li>
                <li>Use programs/scripts as opposed to command-line instructions!</li>
                <li>Design your code to be run all at once, and not section by section. Create a master file that call all other subsidiary files.</li>
                <li>Use log-files. Make sure that the code stores the output as opposed to only showing it on the screen during runtime.</li>
                <li>Make your code produce all tables and figures as they appear in the manuscript: you will save a lot of time!</li>
                <li>Set the paths at the top of the master-file and then use either relative paths or global variables, so that users don't have to change the paths in multiple parts of your code.</li>
                <li>Whenever possible, write paths in a way that is compatible across different operating systems. For example, in Stata, always use forward slashes &quot;/&quot; to separate directories, even if you use Windows.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Data Editors of the American Economic Association (<a href="https://www.vilhuber.com/lars/">Lars Vilhuber</a>) the Review of Economic Studies (<a href="https://koren.mk/">Mikl&oacute;s Koren</a>), the Canadian Journal of Economics (<a href="http://www.connolly.uqam.ca/index_en.html">Marie Connolly</a>) and the Economic Journal (<a href="http://pareto.uab.cat/jllull/">Joan Llull</a>) are coordinating reproduciblity requirements and guidelines across different journals. An example of this cooperation is this <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/">common guidance by Social Science Data Editors</a>.

            <h2 id="submit">Submit your package</h2>
            
            <p>
                Submit your final files and replication package via <a href="https://editorialexpress.com/ej">Editorial Express</a>. If size permits, submit all files into one zip file. If necessary, you can split your zip file into multiple smaller size files (for example using <a href="https://kb.winzip.com/help/winzip/help_splitdlg.htm">this</a>). 
            </p>
            <p>
                If the files are still too large for the Editorial Express platform, please contact the Data Editor at <a href="mailto:ejdataeditor@gmail.com">ejdataeditor&#64;gmail.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you were granted a data exemption <b>at the time of first submission</b> (see <a href="before.htm#exemptions">here</a>,  <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>, and <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a> for details), and you are allowed to provide the Data Editor and the replication team with temporary access to your restricted data for the sole purpose of the reproducibility checks, you should include the confidential data <b>in a separate folder</b> named &quot;4 Confidential data not for publication&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                 The content of this folder will be destroyed after the reproducibility checks are completed. All replicators and the Data Editor have signed confidentiality agreements that protect your submission.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you can provide temporary access but not by sharing the data in the &quot;4 Confidential data not for publication&quot; folder,  please contact the Data Editor at <a href="mailto:ejdataeditor@gmail.com">ejdataeditor&#64;gmail.com</a> to arrange an alternative access method. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A few days after you submitted the package (in most of the cases, within two weeks) you will be contacted by the Data Editor with the outcome of the reproducibility checks, regardless of whether the checks were successful or there are modifications to be made. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to implement modifications of your package, you will be instructed to do so in the Data Editor's response. You will iterate with the Data Editor until the reproducibility checks are satisfactory concluded.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="publish">After the reproducibility checks are completed: publish your package</h2>
            
            <p>
                <b>Once the reproducibility checks are concluded</b>, you will be requested to do an additional step: to publish your replication package at the <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/ej-replication-repository">Economic Journal's community of Zenodo</a>. To do so, you need to complete the following steps:

                <li>Compress your replication package (the <b>exact</b> folder &quot;3 Replication package&quot; that went through the reproducibility checks) on a zip file. Drag-and-drop the zip file to upload it. Make sure you only publish the replication package and not the paper or online appendices. Especially, <b>do not publish the content of the  &quot;4 Confidential data not for publication&quot; folder!</b></li>

                        <li>Description: write a full citation to your manuscript as a description of what the replication package contains.</li>

                <li>Save and then Publish using the corresponding buttons that appear both at the bottom and at the page. This will notify the Data Editor who will review that the files you submitted correspond to those that went to the reproducibility checks.</li>
