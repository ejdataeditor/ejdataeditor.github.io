                <b>What is the exact nature of the reproducibility checks carried out at the Economic Journal?</b>
            </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The purpose of the reproducibility checks carried out at the Economic Journal is to verify three aspects of the replication package: (i) it is complete, in the sense of producing each table, figure, and in-text number in the paper and its appendices, including those online; (ii) it is self-contained, in the sense of not requiring a subprogram or module not included in the package; and (iii) the data and code are adequately documented for other researchers to be able to use them to replicate the results in the paper. When the data are accessible (included in the package or, in case of exemptions, via temporary access by the reproducibility team), the checks ensure that the code exactly reproduces the results in the paper and its appendices. In the case of a data exemption, authors may provide simulated or synthetic data to check that the code runs and produces all output, but the exact results cannot be checked. <br>
                    
                    Reproducibility checks (not replication checks) are conducted. This means that our checks <b><i>do not</i></b> screen for coding errors, discrepancies between what the paper claims the code does and what it actually does, econometric errors, or whether the empirical approach followed in the paper can be reproduced in other environments or other datasets.

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Yes, the replication package should produce each table, figure, and in-text number in the paper and its appendices, including those online. All these codes are checked for their ability to produce the results in the paper and appendices.

                <b>Why is the Economic Journal running reproducibility checks? Why not replication checks?</b>

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    We firmly believe that reproducibility and replicability are the main pillars of science. The nature of replication checks requires time, effort, and resources that journals typically do not have: the publication process should be speedy for science to advance at the right pace. Our reproducibility checks provide a necessary first step: to ensure that authors publish all available data and the codes that generate the results they present in the papers we publish, and, importantly, to check that these codes and data run and produce the published results. The certification that we provide enhances transparency, since it assures that other researchers can reproduce the published research and test it against other datasets, assumptions, methods, etc. It also provides an additional service to the authors, as we often detect small errors that are better amended before publication than in an erratum afterwards.

                <p>
                    Even publicly available data should be included in the replication package to ensure they remain available in the future for anyone who wants to replicate your results. The only exception is when your exact extract is published in a &quot;trusted&quot; repository (see the following <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_hosting.html#trusted-repositories">list</a> for guidance) with a permanent DOI. This is important, because datasets are often updated (or removed) by the provider, and your version of the data may no longer be available to researchers in the future.

                <p>
                    Each provider offers a different policy regarding re-distribution of original and transformed datasets. Some providers, for example, allow re-distribution as long as your extract is deposited in a specific repository. You should make sure about the restrictions to publish your data before the first submission. You should also make sure to seek permission from the original owner of the data to publish them, and make sure to cite the original source accordingly.

                <p>
                    Yes, you can request an exemption on the grounds that the data are restricted-access. The request should be made <b><i>at the time of initial submission</i></b>, in a cover letter addressed to the Editor. The Editor in charge of your submission will determine whether your request is justified before submitting the paper to referees. If the Editor decides against the exemption, the manuscript will not be sent to referees, and you will be requested to either accept the data policy or otherwise the paper will be rejected. Submission fees will not be returned in that case. When an exemption is needed for a dataset that is incorporated to the analysis during the editorial process, the exemption should be requested at the first iteration in which the new data are incorporated.

                    Yes. Restricted access data is generally discouraged, but when the nature of your research largely relies on a specific dataset and cannot be conducted on an open alternative, those data are eligible for an exemption. However, you may be requested to provide a certification from the provider indicating that the data will be archived and made available to other users following the same procedure to request access to it.

                    If you were granted a data exemption, your paper would still need to go through reproducibility checks before final acceptance. In order to do so, you can either (i) grant temporary (distance or physical) access to the data to the reproducibility team for the sole purpose of the checks (the data will be destroyed or access terminated after the checks), or (ii) supply simulated or synthetic dataset(s) instead of the one(s) used in the analysis.

                <p>

                <p>
                    Whenever feasible, we strongly recommend providing temporary access to  restricted data. There are numerous advantages of this approach: (i) it saves the effort of producing synthetic or simulated datasets; (ii) the certification provided by the journal is stronger in the sense that we certify that we have been able to reproduce the results published in the paper as opposed to only checking that the code is complete, runs, and produces output for all tables, figures, and in-text numbers published in the article and its printed and online appendices; (iii) we can detect if the results cannot be reproduced, which gives the authors a chance to fix any errors before publication.

                    The reproducibility team will treat the data with the highest ethical standards, preventing any violations of confidentiality, and using them exclusively to run the reproducibility checks. The restricted datasets will be destroyed as soon as the  checks are performed and, therefore, they will not be published.

                    Even if you cannot provide direct access to the reproducibility team, this option is preferred to the simulated/synthetic dataset alternative as long as the checks can be executed in a reasonable amount of time. In this case, you need to supply the replication package to the journal and the contact of the data provider.

                    Our view is that, when reproducibility checks cannot be performed on real data, there is still an advantage of running them on such simulated/synthetic datasets: they are still useful to make sure the code is complete and self-contained, and that it runs without errors.

                    In order to generate a dataset that mimics the same characteristics as the original one, the synthetic option may be easier. There are many open source routines that do it for you. However, there are also two main disadvantages: (i) you need to make sure that your scrambling/perturbation algorithm ensures correct anonymization of the data; and (ii) non-linear estimation routines may not converge on synthetic data, whereas they are more likely to converge in an artificial dataset generated by the model that you are estimating.

                    The reproducibility checks are handled by our Data Editor and our reproducibility team: a team of advanced Ph.D. students that have been hired to carry out the checks under the supervision of the Data Editor. Once an article is conditionally accepted for publication at the Economic Journal, the authors are requested to submit the replication package along with other production files. Upon submission, the Data Editor assigns the package to one or several members of the reproducibility team. The reproducibility team provides the Data Editor with a report summarizing the outcome of the checks. After reviewing it, the Data Editor contacts the authors informing them about the outcome of the replication checks, and eventually requests them to amend the package if needed. Once the replication checks are completed, the article is transferred back to the original Editor, who is in charge of final acceptance. If results in the paper need to be modified as a result of the checks, the original Editor in charge will be responsible for approving these changes before acceptance. If these changes imply a modification of the message of the paper, the original Editor can decide to reject the paper. Final acceptance is conditional on full reproducibility.

For example, this can entail a reduced number of replications of a simulation exercise, the code that solves a structural model for a given set of parameters, a simplified function to test an optimization routine, etc. Such a simplified &quot;testing&quot; version will be published along with the original code in your replication package. This is so because we believe that these testing versions are extremely useful for other researchers that want to understand and use your code for replication or  their related research, enhancing transparency and increasing the visibility of your research.

                    Whenever possible, the easiest way is to provide a physical copy of your data by including it in a separate folder labeled &quot;4 Confidential data not for publication&quot; outside of the replication package. All replicators and the Data Editor have signed confidentiality agreements that prevent them to use the data for any other purpose than the reproducibility checks. When that option is not feasible, we recommend you to contact our Data Editor to arrange the best way to provide access to the reproducibility team.

                   Yes, you should and it is very important to do so. When submitted to production, your package is handled by different people at the Economic Journal and at the publisher, not all of them familiarized with data and code.

The only exception is when your replication package is published in a &quot;trusted&quot; repository (see the following <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_hosting.html#trusted-repositories">list</a> for guidance) with a permanent DOI. In that case, your DOI can be used to link your article with your package, and the Data Editor can wave the requirement to publish the package at the Economic Journal's community at Zenodo. However, publishing your package at the Economic Journal's community at Zenodo is recommended, because it increases the visibility of your package.
